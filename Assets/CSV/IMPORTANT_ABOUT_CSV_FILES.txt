Note:

In order for the csv file to be properly processed, it has to be saved as Mcintosh csv format, not anything else! 

Special:
 
Under this column the number will indicate <<which>> special effect we want to apply to the current
dialogue. e.g. Special Effect #1 is to change sprite in the middle of the dialogue, the columns after
special are the parameters to this special effect. So for #1 it might be after which character to 
change sprite, and change into what sprite, etc.
